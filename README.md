#  Parkinson's disease prediction project using     machine learning

In the Parkinson's disease prediction project using machine learning, we employed advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret data related to Parkinson's disease. Leveraging features extracted from medical assessments, patient demographics, and other relevant parameters, the goal was to build predictive models that can accurately classify individuals as either having Parkinson's disease or being healthy. This project showcased the potential of machine learning in aiding early detection and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, enabling timely intervention and improved patient care. The insights gained emphasized the role of data-driven approaches in supporting medical professionals and enhancing the overall understanding and management of Parkinson's disease.
